<h2> Introduction </h2>
<p>ConMaster5 is an Open Source web-based system for managing conventions, especially 
  gaming conventions. Conventions are organized gatherings of people at a common 
  place to share knowledge, socialize, and have fun. Gaming conventions focus 
  on playing games of various types to achieve these ends. ConMaster5 manages 
  conventions by keeping track of the people associated with the convention, and 
  what they are doing when. For small coventions, this is not a big deal, but 
  for larger gatherings, managing these details becomes a full-time task that 
  is made easier by effective software. </p>
<p>A brief note on the designation ConMaster5 - There have been 4 previous versions 
  of convention management software release under the ConMaster moniker by Tim 
  White and C/Face Design. These were for use in Denver, Colorado gaming conventions 
  and for RPGA(tm) Network score packet management. These previous versions were 
  built in ACI's 4th Dimension, and were not open source. ConMaster5 continues 
  the ConMaster tradition, bringing it into a modern, and open source world. </p>
<p>At heart, ConMaster5 is very similar to a school registration system. It allows 
  convention staff to track people, and the events they register for and participate 
  in. These people might be simply participating, as students might, or they might 
  be a judge, analogous to an instructor in our school analogy. For events that 
  are scored, and a winner determined, these scores and placements are tracked, 
  much like grades. Hopefully keeping this school model in mind will help you 
  identify with the functions and data structures of ConMaster5. </p>
<h2> 
ConMaster5 Goals </h2> 
<p>Many goals were set forth for ConMaster5, many as a result of previous ConMaster 
  shortcomings. </p>
<ul>
  <li> Provide an easy-to-use convention management platform </li>
  <li>Provide an open source option for distribution </li>
  <li>Allow multiple developers to develop it with no special software </li>
  <li>Require minimal client-machine installation </li>
  <li>Be easily customizable by most end-users </li>
  <li>Be easily extensible by skilled end-users</li>
  <li>Be as platform-independent as possible, especially for the client </li>
  <li>Encourage, but not require a proven convention management methodology </li>
  <li>Be integratable into other gaming or convention related software </li>
  <li>Be extremely easy to maintain, install and setup </li>
  <li>Provide flexible archtecture for various usage scenarios </li>
  <li>Allow multiple ConMaster5 users to share a single data repository </li>
  <li>Provide flexible and easy-to-use import and export capabilities</li>
  <li>Allow developers of varying skill and experience to contribute</li>
</ul>
<h2> 
ConMaster5 Architecture </h2> 
<p>To meet the ConMaster5 goals, many architectures were considered before the 
  current architecture took shape.</p>
<p>The advantage of the current architecture is that it enables the majority of 
  the ConMaster5 goals, but it is not without disadvantages, some of which are 
  listed here:</p>
<ul>
PHP is not often used in production corporate environments, and thus may not be a technology that contributors want to learn</li>
  <li>PHP is going through a lot of revisions, and keeping up with the latest can be challenging</li>
  <li>Free IDE's are immature, and commerical IDE's aren't cheap.</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite these disadvantages, it remains, after much consideration, the best 
  architecture to meet the stated goals.</p>

<pre>These items are connected in a 3-tier architecture as shown below:


***********        ***************          ************
* Client  *        * Application *          * Database * 
*         *        * Server      *          * Server   *
***********        ***************          ************
* Web     *<-HTTP->* Apache      *          *          *

                   ***************          ************
</pre>
<p><br>
  Since one of ConMaster5's goals is to provide a flexible architecture, these 
  three tiers can be collapsed in various ways onto a single piece of hardware. 
  Note also that the links between tiers could be LAN, dial-up, or internal. Logically, 
  the functions of ConMaster5 are broken up like this: </p>
<pre>
****************    *********************    ************ 
* Presentation *    * Business    Logic *    * Storage  * 
****************    *********************    ************ 
* HTML         *    * PHP Form Control  *    *          *
*   ||         *<-->*      Objects      *    *          *
* JavaScript   *    *        ||         *    *          *
*              *    * PHP Data Control  *    * MySQL    * 
*              *    *      Objects      *<-->* Database *

<h3>High-Level Technology Overview</h3>
<p>Conmaster5 uses a web browser at its client, in order to provide as much client-hardware 
  &amp; OS flexibility as possible, and to ease both self-service registration 
  on the internet, and multi-user convention management access.</p>
<p>To enable a web browser as a client, you need a web server and we are using 
  Apache. PHP actually will run under other web servers (IIS), but we are focusing 
  on as portable a server-side solution as we can, and that means Apache. And 
  to some degree, it's just insane not to use Apache.</p>
<p>So your web browser request hits Apache, and if the page name ends in .php, 
  then it gets passed to the PHP extension. PHP parses the file, quickly compiles 
  it, and then executes it. Although it is an interpreted language, PHP runs extremely 
  fast, due to a great engine and smart caching algorithms. The parsed code will 
  interact with the database, probably calling other .php files along the way. 
  Once the database interaction is done, the results are merged with a .html template 
  file and sent to the user. In this way the Business Logic and database interaction 
  are separated from the HTML presentation. In fact, a user could use a GUI HTML 
  editor such as FrontPage or DreamWeaver to build their own HTML forms for ConMaster, 
  without writing a single lick of PHP code! (Or even, in most cases, looking 
  at the HTML code view!). This plays nicely to our &quot;let people with varying 
  levels of skill contribute&quot; goal.</p>
<p>Why a SQL database and not an object database? Mostly becuase object database 
  performance, scalability, and reliability has yet to reach the level of SQL 
  databases. Also, the SQL developer knowledge base is much larger, as is the 
  availability of reporting tools. </p>
<h2> 
ConMaster5 Tools </h2> 
<p>The choices of tools to support the goals are few - the open source requirement 
  narrows the field considerably, as does the requirement that development tools 
  be low (preferably no) cost. We've done our best to pick the best of the open 
  source/free breed for these tools, which sometimes means the best support, not 
  the most elegant tool. </p>
