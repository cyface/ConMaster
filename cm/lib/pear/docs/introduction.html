>&#13;    PEAR is short for "PHP Extension and Application Repository" and
    is pronounced just like the fruit.  The purpose of PEAR is to
    provide:

><P
>&#13;     The code in PEAR is partitioned in "packages".  Each package
     is a separate project with its own development team, version
     number, release cycle, documentation and a defined relation to
     other packages (including dependencies).  Packages are
     distributed as gzipped tar files with a description file inside,
     and installed on your local system using the PEAR installer.
    </P
><P
>&#13;     There are two types of packages: source packages (containing
     source files only), and binary packages (containing
     platform-specific binary files, and possible source files).
     Installing source packages with C code obviously requires a C
     build environment.
    </P
><P
>&#13;     PEAR defines a package tree, where each "node" in the tree is
     represented by a part of the package name.  The nodes are
     organized by simple descriptive topics, and each part is
     separated by an underscore.  Examples of package names are
     "MP3_Id", "Archive_Tar" and "HTTP_Post".
    </P
><P
>&#13;     Packages may relate to eachother through explicit dependencies,
     but there is no automatic relation between for example a package
     and its "parent" in the package tree (for example, "HTTP_Post" is
     by default independent of "HTTP").
    </P
><P
>&#13;     A few top-level nodes in the package tree called
     "sub-repositories" have special functions, currently these are
     <A
HREF="introduction.html#about-pecl"
>PECL</A
>, <A
HREF="introduction.html#about-gtk"
>Gtk</A
> and <A
HREF="introduction.html#about-app"
>App</A
>.  For each of these, different
     rules apply, see more in the description of each sub-repository
     below.
    </P
><P
>&#13;     A style guide, the <A
HREF="standards.html"
>PEAR Coding
     Standards</A
> (short PCS), exists to ease collaboration
     between PEAR developers, to help quality and portability, and to
     help PEAR contributors to provide consistent-looking-and-feeling
     APIs.  For packages in the <A
HREF="introduction.html#about-pfc"
>PFC</A
>,
     this standard applies strictly, for non-PFC packages it applies
     more relaxed.

>&#13;     All PEAR packages are registered in and uploaded to a central
     database available at pear.php.net.  Open-sourced
     third-party packages may also be registered and uploaded.
     Closed-source packages may be installed by the PEAR installer,
     but the PEAR database is for open-source code only.
    </P
><P
>&#13;     Pear.php.net will provide both a human-friendly (HTML) and
     machine-friendly (currently XML-RPC) interface to the PEAR
     database.  Package downloads are done with plain HTTP.

></H2
><P
>&#13;     The PHP Foundation Classes is a subset of PEAR that focuses on
     quality, generality, interoperability and compatibility.  If
     PHP is going to continue bundling PEAR packages beyond the
     installer, it will bundle the PFC.
    </P
><P
>&#13;     Focus on quality means that no packages or releases or less than "stable"
     quality are accepted in the PFC.
    </P
><P
>&#13;     Generality means that packages should not be more than reasonably
     specific to any type of environment (such as an output format
     like HTML, an operating system, a web server or SAPI backend
     etc).
    </P
><P
>&#13;     Interoperable packages work well with other packages, have
     stable, standardized APIs, prefer other well-established (and
     also interoperable) components and also work well in different
     environments (PHP version, SAPI backend, operating system etc.)
    </P
><P
>&#13;     Compatibility is not just about supporting the same syntax and
     semantics as earlier versions, it is also about planning ahead
     when writing the code.  Designing code so it would be easy, or at
     least possible, to add features that are likely to appear later,
     gives code that is also "forward-compatible".

><P
>&#13;     PECL (pronounced "pickle") is a sub-repository of PEAR for C
     extensions ala those distributed with PHP 4, in fact, having
     somewhere to move extensions to from PHP was one of the
     motivations when creating PECL.  Extensions in PECL follow PHP's
     coding standards rather than PEAR's, but they are distributed and
     installed as PEAR packages.
