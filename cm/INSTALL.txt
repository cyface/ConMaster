To set up an appropriate server enviornment, you need: 

1) Apache (http://apache.org) 
2) MySQL (3.22+) (http://mysql.com) 
3) PHP 4.1.2+ (http://www.php.net) 
4) phpMyAdmin (http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/phpMyAdmin) 

If you are planning on doing development, I also recommend PHPEdit (http://www.phpedit.com) make sure to download the latest (not the stable) version, or you will need to practice your French. 

These tools are available for windoze, Mac OS X, and of course, Linux. Red Hat Linux 7.3 has appropriate versions of everything but phpMyAdmin pre-installed. 

Follow the basic instructions with each package to install them. I was able to install everything on my windoze2k box in about 30 minutes the first time I did it, and 15 the next. 

You will need to create a database in your MySQL (I usually call it cyface), and a user that has full control over that database. You can use phpMyAdmin to do this. (You will first need to configure phpMyAdmin (config.inc.php in the phpMyAdmin directory) to run as the root user so that you can log in and create a new db). 

Once you have done that, edit the top line of the cyface.ini file in the cm/lib/DataObjects directory to point at the new database & user. 

Rename the appropriate htaccess- files to .htaccess, and browse to <yourhost>cm/index.html

Apache installation tips

If you change the document root (it starts as something like C:\program files\apache group\apache\htdocs) make sure you update the second place in the httpd.conf that says "change this to whatever you set the document root to", or your .htaccess files will not work.
Also, make sure you set your .htaccess files to Allow All, so that the cm .htaccess can set the PHP include_path.

Make sure you follow the directions for installing PHP as a SAPI module under apache.



MySQL installation tips

Windoze
To install MySQL as a service (which is what you want to do) run the winmysqladmin.exe app in the bin directory after you install MySql.  It will prompt you to create a password for the root user.  Supply one, and you should be started.  A systray app (that looks like a traffic light) will run to let you start and stop the database.
